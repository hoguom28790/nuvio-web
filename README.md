## About

NuvioWeb is an independent, GPL-3.0-licensed community fork of Nuvio, maintained by alphasquare.

It provides a client-side playback interface with support for the Stremio addon ecosystem, enabling content discovery and source resolution through user-installed extensions.

NuvioWeb is based on the original Nuvio project and preserves credit and attribution to its upstream maintainers and main repository.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- Python 3, for local static hosting

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alphasquare404/NuvioWeb.git
cd NuvioWeb
npm install
```

### Run the Web App Locally

```bash
npm run build
python3 -m http.server 8080 -d dist
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Self-host with Docker

NuvioWeb runs from published GHCR images. A self-host server needs only Docker
Compose, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.env`; it does not need a source checkout,
Node.js, npm, or a local image build.

### Quick Deploy with Docker

Quick Deploy requires an AMD64/x86_64 Linux host with Docker Engine, the Docker
Compose plugin (`docker compose`), and `curl`. The current published container
images are `linux/amd64`. You do not need Git, Node.js, npm, a source checkout,
or a local image build.

On the server, create an empty deployment directory and download the Compose
file and configuration template:

```bash
mkdir -p nuvioweb
cd nuvioweb

curl -fsSL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphasquare404/NuvioWeb/web/docker-compose.yml \
  -o docker-compose.yml

curl -fsSL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphasquare404/NuvioWeb/web/.env.example \
  -o .env
```

For the normal frontend-only deployment, the downloaded `.env` already uses the
hosted Nuvio backend defaults, so you can start NuvioWeb immediately:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

`docker compose ps` should show these four NuvioWeb services running:

- `nuvioweb`
- `nuvioweb-trakt-auth-bridge`
- `nuvioweb-debrid-api-bridge`
- `nuvioweb-external-return-bridge`

Open `http://SERVER_IP:4173`. Set `NUVIO_PORT` in `.env` before starting if
you need a different host port. You can also edit `.env` for Simkl, Premiumize,
Trakt, or a custom/self-hosted compatible Nuvio backend. See
[environment configuration](docs/environment.md) for every supported value.

### Configuration

The downloaded `.env` template includes safe hosted-backend defaults and labels
browser-public versus server-only values. Do not create an empty Supabase
project for the frontend-only mode. Replace the Nuvio backend values only when
you operate your own compatible backend; the full mapping and advanced options
are in [environment configuration](docs/environment.md).

Docker builds a generic browser image. At container startup, an explicit
public allowlist is written to `nuvio.env.js`, so changing `.env` only requires
recreating the container, not rebuilding the image:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

`TRAKT_CLIENT_ID`, `SIMKL_CLIENT_ID`, `SIMKL_APP_NAME`, and
`PREMIUMIZE_CLIENT_ID` are browser-public runtime values. The frontend receives
only `TRAKT_CLIENT_ID`; `TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET` and `TRAKT_REDIRECT_URI` are
server-only values passed exclusively to the internal `trakt-auth-bridge`
container. Nginx routes only `/api/trakt/*` to that sidecar; neither server
value is written to `nuvio.env.js`, bundled, or exposed on a host port. Never
place Supabase service-role keys, access tokens, provider credentials, or other
private values in browser runtime configuration.

### Release Channels

Use the default `:stable` tag for normal self-hosting. To switch channels, edit
all four `image:` tags in `docker-compose.yml` to the same tag before pulling.

| Tag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `stable` | Recommended. Latest official release. |
| `nightly` | Latest development build from `web`; may be unstable. |
| `latest` | Most recently published project build, whether development or release. |
| `X.Y.Z` | Pinned immutable release, such as `0.1.0`. |
| `desktop` | Temporary legacy compatibility alias. |

Examples: use `:stable` for the recommended channel, `:nightly` for the latest
web development build, `:latest` for the newest published build of any kind,
or `:0.1.0` to remain on a specific release.

### Start, Stop, and Update

Run these commands from the deployment directory.

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

Open `http://SERVER_IP:4173`.

```bash
# Follow server logs
docker logs -f nuvioweb

# Stop the application
docker compose down

# Update the selected image channel
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

With `:stable`, this updates to the newest official release. With `:nightly`,
it updates to the newest `web` development build. With `:latest`, it updates to
whichever project build was published most recently. A pinned tag such as
`:0.1.0` remains pinned until you edit all four image tags manually.

### Reverse Proxy

The container serves HTTP on port `80` and Compose maps it to host port `4173`.
It can sit behind an external reverse proxy such as Nginx Proxy Manager, Caddy,
or Traefik for HTTPS and a custom domain; TLS is intentionally not bundled into
this application container.

Use HTTPS in production for installed-PWA and Web Push features.
Return-to-NuvioWeb notifications are optional; see
[environment configuration](docs/environment.md) for setup and fallback behavior.

## Project Structure

- `js/` contains app logic, UI screens, platform adapters, and player code.
- `css/` contains shared responsive styling.
- `assets/` contains icons, branding, and bundled assets.
- `docs/` contains static runtime helper pages used by the app.
- `scripts/` contains browser build, serving, and metadata tooling.
- `dist/` contains generated build output.

## Origins / Credits

This browser/PWA project builds on important community work:

- **tapframe/NuvioTV**
  The original project that shaped Nuvio's product direction.
  https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioTV

- **WhiteGiso/NuvioTV-WebOS**
  An early inspiration for this web codebase.
  https://github.com/WhiteGiso/NuvioTV-WebOS

NuvioWeb builds on that foundation for browsers and installed PWAs. It also
includes web/community work by WhiteGiso, edoedac0, and other contributors.
